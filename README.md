Description: In this mock scenario due to a recent audit, our client's cloud infrastructure is in need of revision. The client needs a fully operational cyber threat detection and response to mitigate possible data exfiltration. Among other threats, we will be specifically defending against HIPAA-classified data exfiltration as stated earlier.
